    <h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I'm a self-confessed life-long learner and autodidact. Initially, I started my learning journey ouside of academics in the area of value Investing.
  Being a rich trove of knowledge, and a skill that evades mastery, I continue to add to my knowledge base in this space. From inception eight years
  ago I've bypassed many fatal learning errors and misconceptions by following the industry greats. Aside from the wealth of knowledge I've gained from
  them over this time, I've realized some of the best ways to jump over learning hurdles in much shorter time frames. This line of reasoning is what gives me
  the confidence to apply these techniques to other, diverse areas of deep technical know-how.</p>

<p>My goal for this page and the next few years is to catalog my learning trek.The start of my journey will be in the area of web developement. I've enrolled in the Udacity bootcamp, taught by <a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/4b4368a3-b5c8-4529-aa65-2056ec31f37e/">Angela Yu </a>
My end goal is to prove that someone with a normal academic backround can teach themselves any skill and accomplish things they hadn't first believed.
In order, my plan of attack will be on 1. Web developement 2. Data science (including Python, R, Tableau, SQL), and 3.Scoring a 700+ on the GMAT (or equivalent GRE).
While the bar has been set extremely high for my first year of Ultralearning, I won't be detured from reaching my goals.</p>
